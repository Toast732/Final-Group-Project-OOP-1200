To use the Delibe Bank Personal Finance Manager, start by registering a new user account through the Register tab
located in the top left corner next to login. Once registered you will recieve confirmation and be directed to log in
with your credentials to access the dashboard.

Once on the Dashboard you might notice it is a little empty. You first need to add some transactions to view your data.

Adding Transactions:
- Navigate up to the tabs and click on 'Add Income'. At the top of the window below the navigation tabs, there is a
dropdown list where you select what type of income you will record.

    One-Time
    - Perfect for when you manage to sell off an asset for quick cash. Record the name of the one-time income followed
    by how much you earned.

    Hourly
    - List your Income Source (work, business, etc), how many hours you worked that week, and how much per hour you
     earned.

    Yearly
    - Record the name of the source of income (ex. Salary pay) and how much it was worth for the year. Perfect for
    those large sources of income you need to better plan use for.

Fill in the necessary details and click save. This will save your income transaction details in a file listed with
your username.

To save an expense, click on 'Add Expense' and fill in the similar details to income and then click save. With these
values, the graph(s) will populate on the Dashboard with your data.

Edit Transaction:
- Navigate to the 'Edit Transactions' tab and view the saved transactions. Use the scroll bar to navigate the available
transactions. If you wish to remove a transaction made in error, simply click the button found right of the transaction
details labelled 'Delete Transaction' and then click 'Save' on the right side of the window.

Investments
-Provides a way to practice your Stock skills with a randomized Stock price. Buy or sell and name the stock you
wish to interact with.

Dashboard
- Now that we have populated some transactions there should be a pie chart displaying in the center of the screen. The
options on the top left of the Monthly Balance Report help you break down what is displayed in the window.

    Gross Profit
    - Overall view of your expenses and income

    Income
    - A breakdown of what income you have recorded

    Expenses
    - A breakdown of what expenses you have recorded

You may also right click on the graphs to see a dropdown of multiple options.

    Properties
    - A properties windows will appear and offer you multiple options to better represent your data.
    On  the title tab you can...

        pick the text used as the title of the graph,
        pick the font and colour,
        and an additional option to toggle the title message.

    On plot you can...

        Change the appearence of the graph and graph lines
        manipulate the data on the pic chart.

    And the Other tab allows you to customize your graph further.


    Copy
    - Copy the graph onto the cache to paste elsewhere

    Save As
    - Store the graph as an image (PNG) onto your desktop

    Print
    - Send a print request to have the graph printed from your printer.

    Zoom In/Out
    - Focus on select parts of the graph you require more detail in. Zoom in gets you closer, Zoom out pulls you
    farther away

    AutoRange
    - property defines how the axis autoranges when data is added. AxisCore.AutoRange = AutoRange.Once (Default Setting)
     The axis will attempt to autorange once to fit the data as you start the chart. Setting an explicit VisibleRange
      on the axis will override this behaviour.


Report and Analysis
-A recap of the stock you have bought and sold. A refresh button is located to the left of the image to ensure
the info displayed is up to date.

Logout
- Click here to end your session and return to the Login/Register page.
